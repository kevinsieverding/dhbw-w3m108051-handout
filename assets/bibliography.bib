	abstract = {Recommender systems represent user preferences for the purpose of suggesting items to purchase or examine. They have become fundamental applications in electronic commerce and information access, providing suggestions that effectively prune large information spaces so that users are directed toward those items that best meet their needs and preferences. A variety of techniques have been proposed for performing recommendation, including content-based, collaborative, knowledge-based and other techniques. To improve performance, these methods have sometimes been combined in hybrid recommenders. This paper surveys the landscape of actual and possible hybrid recommenders, and introduces a novel hybrid, {EntreeC}, a system that combines knowledge-based recommendation and collaborative filtering to recommend restaurants. Further, we show that semantic ratings obtained from the knowledge-based part of the system enhance the effectiveness of collaborative filtering.},

	abstract = {Recommender systems are now popular both commercially and in the research community, where many approaches have been suggested for providing recommendations. In many cases a system designer that wishes to employ a recommendater system must choose between a set of candidate approaches. A first step towards selecting an appropriate algorithm is to decide which properties of the application to focus upon when making this choice. Indeed, recommender systems have a variety of properties that may affect user experience, such as accuracy, robustness, scalability, and so forth. In this paper we discuss how to compare recommenders based on a set of properties that are relevant for the application. We focus on comparative studies, where a few algorithms are compared using some evaluation metric, rather than absolute benchmarking of algorithms. We describe experimental settings appropriate for making choices between algorithms. We review three types of experiments, starting with an offline setting, where recommendation approaches are compared without user interaction, then reviewing user studies, where a small group of subjects experiment with the system and report on the experience, and finally describe large scale online experiments, where real user populations interact with the system. In each of these cases we describe types of questions that can be answered, and suggest protocols for experimentation. We also discuss how to draw trustworthy conclusions from the conducted experiments. We then review a large set of properties, and explain how to evaluate systems given relevant properties. We also survey a large set of evaluation metrics in the context of the property that they evaluate.},

This chapter surveys core methods in the field. Matrix factorization techniques, which became a first choice for implementing {CF}, are described together with other innovations. We also describe several extensions that bring competitive accuracy into neighborhood methods, which used to dominate the field. The chapter demonstrates how to utilize temporal models and implicit feedback to extend model accuracy. In passing, we illustrate the use of {CF} algorithms on the Netflix Prize competition. The {CF} methods discussed in this chapter have been proposed a decade ago but still show state-of-the art accuracy in recent studies. The modeling patterns identified in this chapter are applicable to a variety of recommender problems such as item recommendation, rating prediction, cold start recommendation and context-aware recommenders.},

Examples are recommender systems with integrated multimodal/unstructured data and temporal dynamics. This chapter provides an overview of deep neural networks based recommender systems, with two aims. One is to explain how deep neural networks can be applied to recommendation tasks and the other is to review the recent progress in this field. Specifically, we begin with basic concepts and terminologies about deep neural networks and how they are applied to recommender systems. We then present an overview of the state-of-the-art deep learning based recommendation algorithms, and discuss their strengths and limitations. Finally, we provide an outlook on the future trends and directions which might lead to the next generation of recommender systems.},

We discuss the general notion of context and major approaches to modeling it in recommender systems, including explicit vs. latent and static vs. dynamic approaches. We also discuss three popular algorithmic paradigms—contextual pre-filtering, post-filtering, and modeling—for incorporating contextual information into the recommendation process, and survey the recent advances in contextual modeling that include tensor factorization, deep learning, and reinforcement learning techniques. We also discuss important directions for future research.},

	abstract = {Content-based recommendations suggest items similar to those the user already liked in the past by building a representation of users and items based on descriptive features, which are obtained by processing textual content or low-level characteristics of the items. In this setting, the adoption of semantics-aware representations can be very useful to build a more precise representation of users and items, and, in turn, to generate better recommendations. To this end, this chapter presents a comprehensive survey of the recent trends in the area of semantics-aware content-based recommender systems. The discussion starts with an overview of historical developments, then it covers methods for semantic representations, by splitting the approaches into exogenous and endogenous representation techniques. The former rely on the integration of external knowledge sources, while the latter are based on the hypothesis that the meaning of words depends on their usage in large corpora of textual documents. Next, we discuss recent trends in the area of semantics-aware recommendations. Such trends regard novel representation methods, based on knowledge graphs and embedding techniques, as well as the exploitation of user-generated content (tags, reviews, etc.) and multimedia features. Finally, we conclude our overview by showing how content can be used to support the construction of natural language explanations and to build conversational recommender systems.},
